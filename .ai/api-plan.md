# REST API Plan

## 1. Resources

- User: Represents a user's anonymous profile. Corresponds to the `users` collection in Firestore.
- Chat: Represents a conversation request or an active chat's metadata. Corresponds to the `chats` collection in Firestore.
- Message: Represents an individual chat message during an active conversation. Stored temporarily in Realtime Database. (No standard REST endpoints for real-time messages, handled by RTDB SDK).
- Report: Represents a user's report against another user. Corresponds to the `reports` collection in Firestore.
- ArchivedMessage: Represents a message moved from Realtime Database to cold storage. Corresponds to the `chatMessagesArchive` collection in Firestore.

## 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication will be used for user registration and login via email and password. All API endpoints (implemented via Cloud Functions or accessed directly via client SDK + Security Rules) will require a valid authenticated user. The user's UID will be available from the authentication context.
- **Authorization:** Access control will be primarily enforced using Firebase Security Rules for both Firestore and Realtime Database.
  - Users can only read/write their own `/users/{userId}` document (except limited public fields on others).
  - Users can query `/users` collection but receive only limited public fields and are filtered by location/activity.
  - Users can create documents in the `/chats` collection (sending a request).
  - Users can read/update chat documents in `/chats` only if their UID is in the `participantIds` array. Special rules for accepting/rejecting (must be the recipient, status 'pending').
  - Users can create documents in the `/reports` collection.
  - Users cannot read/modify documents in the `/reports` collection after creation (except possibly for moderators/admins via separate rules or Cloud Functions).
  - In Realtime Database, rules for `/messages/{chatId}/` will ensure reads/writes are only allowed if the authenticated user's UID is one of the participants implied by `{chatId}`.
  - Admin/Moderator access to `reports` and `chatMessagesArchive` will require specific authorization logic (e.g., Firebase Auth Custom Claims or checking against an admin UID list) enforced by Security Rules or within Cloud Functions if endpoints are implemented there.

## 4. Validation and Business Logic

- **Validation:**

  - All required fields in request payloads must be present.
  - Data types must match schema definition (e.g., string, timestamp).
  - String fields may have length constraints (TBD).
  - Enum fields (`gender`, `location.type`, `chat.status`, `report.type`) must use allowed values.
  - `pseudonym` must be unique across all users (enforced server-side, likely via Cloud Function or transaction on user creation/update).
  - `location` structure must be valid.
  - `participantIds` array in `chats` must contain exactly two valid UIDs.
  - `reportedUserId` in `reports` must be a valid existing user UID.
  - Timestamp fields (`lastSeen`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `endedAt`, `timestamp`, `archivedAt`, `messageData.time`) must be valid timestamps.

- **Business Logic Implementation:**
  - **Profile Creation/Update:** Handled via POST/PUT `/users`. Server-side logic ensures pseudonym uniqueness and validates input. `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps are managed server-side.
  - **Nearby Search:** Handled via GET `/users` with query parameters. Server-side logic performs the filtering by `location.type`, `location.value`, and `lastSeen` using Firestore queries and indexes. Limits public fields in the response.
  - **Chat Initiation:** Handled via POST `/chats`. Server-side logic creates the initial chat document with status "pending" and the initiator's UID. Checks if a pending/active chat already exists between participants.
  - **Chat Request Management (Accept/Reject):** Handled via PUT `/chats/{chatId}/accept` and `/chats/{chatId}/reject`. Server-side logic verifies the user is the recipient and the chat status is 'pending' before updating the status to 'active' or 'rejected'. Uses transactions for atomic updates if needed.
  - **Chat Ending:** Handled via PUT `/chats/{chatId}/end`. Server-side logic verifies the user is a participant and status is 'active' before setting status to 'ended'. This action triggers the archival process (see below).
  - **Real-time Chat Messaging:** Handled directly by Firebase Realtime Database SDK. Server-side logic (Security Rules) ensures only participants can write messages.
  - **Reporting:** Handled via POST `/reports`. Server-side logic creates the report document. A Cloud Function triggered by this creation will increment the `reportCount` on the `reportedUserId`'s user document atomically using a transaction.
  - **10-Report Threshold:** Logic triggered by the Cloud Function monitoring the `reportCount` on user documents. When the count reaches 10, it initiates the manual verification procedure (details of notification/workflow for "responsible persons" are outside this API plan scope).
  - **Chat Archival:** A separate server-side process (likely Firebase Cloud Functions scheduled or triggered by chat ending) runs periodically (every 30 days as per decision) to move messages from RTDB to the `chatMessagesArchive` collection in Firestore for chats marked as 'ended' or inactive for a period. Requires robust logic to read from RTDB, write to Firestore (batched writes recommended), and delete from RTDB atomically and reliably.
  - **Active Status Update:** Handled via PUT `/users/{userId}` updating the `lastSeen` field periodically from the client. Server-side logic (Security Rules) ensures only the user can update their own status. Consider optimizing write frequency or using RTDB Presence.
  - **Moderation Workflow (Basic):** Access to view and update reports (e.g., status) requires specific authorization. This is handled by Security Rules or logic within Cloud Functions if dedicated moderator endpoints were built.
